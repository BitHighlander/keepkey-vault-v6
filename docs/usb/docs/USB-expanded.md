It is possible for a Tauri app’s Rust backend to open and even claim a USB interface, but whether the call succeeds depends on two things that aren’t obvious when you only test a CLI with sudo:

Platform	Why rusb “just works” in a root CLI	What blocks it in a signed Tauri GUI	How to unblock (or work around)
Linux	Running as root bypasses udev and ACL checks.	The packaged app runs as an ordinary user, so the kernel still owns the interface and your process lacks read/write permission.	Ship a udev rule (installed by your .deb/.rpm or shown to the user) such as
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2b24", ATTR{idProduct}=="0001", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev" and make sure your code sets handle.set_auto_detach_kernel_driver(true) before claim_interface

Windows	Admin rights let Zadig / WinUSB replace the stock driver so rusb can take exclusive control.	In a normal install the Microsoft HID driver still owns Interface 1, so claim_interface on that interface fails; Interface 0 may succeed.	Either talk HID via hidapi (shared-access) or instruct power users to install a winusb/libusbK driver with Zadig.
macOS	sudo lets rusb open Interface 0 (bulk/bootloader).	macOS never allows a user-space process—even root—to detach the HID kernel driver, so claiming Interface 1 (Access denied) simply isn’t supported. A sandboxed, signed app also needs the right USB entitlement.	1. Keep using rusb for the non-HID bootloader interface.
2. Use IOKit HIDManager / hidapi for normal mode.
3. Add an Entitlements.plist containing:
   xml<br><key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key><true/><key>com.apple.security.device.usb</key><true/>
   and reference it in tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > entitlements

When it still won’t claim
Check signing: on macOS the hardened-runtime build must include the USB entitlement or the kernel will deny ioctls even for Interface 0.

Double-check interface numbers: Bootloader vs. main HID interface often swap PIDs; claim the one that the OS hasn’t already bound to HID.

Ship a tiny privileged helper: Some wallets bundle a CLI that users can run with sudo the first time to flash firmware, while the GUI sticks to HID for everyday use.

So: Tauri itself isn’t the obstacle—the same rusb code runs fine inside the Rust core—but GUI apps lose the implicit root privileges you had in a test shell, and macOS hides HID interfaces from libusb entirely. Once you handle the OS-specific permission model (udev rules, driver choice, macOS entitlements) a packaged Tauri app can open and claim USB devices just like your CLI.

Why libusb_detach_kernel_driver() never works on macOS
HID interfaces are owned by the in-kernel IOHIDFamily driver as soon as the cable is plugged in.
The driver is running inside the kernel’s address space, not as a user–space kext, so there’s no user-land ioctl you can send to make it “let go.” libusb_detach_kernel_driver() therefore always returns LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED on macOS, even when you run as root. The libusb FAQ is blunt: “Do not use libusb with HID devices under macOS – it will not work.”
GitHub

Historically (pre-Ventura) there was no public API to force a capture of a USB interface the way Linux does. Starting with macOS 13 Apple exposed an experimental “USBDeviceCapture” routine behind a private entitlement, but it captures the whole composite device, not an individual interface, and it still doesn’t detach HID on a per-interface basis. You need the managed entitlement com.apple.vm.device-access, available only by filing a request with Apple, and it can’t be used by command-line tools.
GitHub

What you can do instead
Goal	Viable macOS technique	Notes for KeepKey
Talk to bootloader (Interface 0, bulk)	Keep using rusb/libusb. Interface 0 isn’t HID, so the kernel hasn’t claimed it. No special entitlement needed.	This is how firmware flashing usually works.
Talk to main wallet UX (Interface 1, HID)	Use IOHIDManager (directly or via hidapi). The system HID driver stays loaded; IOHIDManager gives you shared read/write access to interrupt and control reports.	All day-to-day traffic (GetFeatures, SignTx, etc.) can go through HID without ever claiming the interface.
Exclusive capture of the whole device	Ship a privileged helper (CLI invoked with sudo) that calls USBDeviceCapture or unloads the kernel kext with kextunload. GUI talks to the device over a domain socket/pipe.	The helper is a few hundred lines of Rust + launchd plist; it never ships to the Mac App Store so you don’t need Apple’s managed entitlement.
Ship a sandboxed Tauri app on the Mac App Store	Add an entitlements file with:
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key><true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.usb</key><true/>	com.apple.security.device.usb simply lets IOHIDManager enumerate devices from inside the sandbox; it does not let you detach the HID driver.

No PID/VID filter is necessary unless you want to tighten the sandbox further.

Key take-aways for your build
Don’t fight the kernel for Interface 1. Route normal traffic through HID (IOHIDManager or hidapi), keep rusb for the bootloader.

A notarised, non-sandboxed Tauri app can use both APIs without any USB entitlements; you only need com.apple.security.device.usb after you enable the sandbox.

Exclusive capture is now possible but over-kill for a hardware wallet, and still gated by Apple’s managed entitlement or a sudo helper.

If your desktop companion must flash firmware from the sandboxed GUI, bundle a tiny keepkey-flasher CLI signed with hardened runtime, invoke it with AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges, and keep the GUI sandbox clean.

Once you treat macOS HID as shared instead of claimable, the “Interface 1: Access denied” error disappears, and the same Rust core works unchanged inside Tauri.

but I can use rusb with sudo and it works

Why sudo + rusb “works” in your CLI but a Tauri GUI bombs out
Layer	What happens in the CLI	Why the identical call fails in a Tauri bundle
Privileges	You run cargo run … under root. libusb can jump straight to IOKit and call the experimental kernel-detach routine Apple added in macOS 13. A root process is implicitly trusted to use it, so libusb_detach_kernel_driver() on Interface 1 succeeds.	Your Tauri app runs as your login user (and, if you’ve enabled the sandbox for Mac App Store compliance, inside a sandbox). No entitlement → the kernel denies the detach request (kIOReturnNotPermitted), so claim_interface returns “Access denied”.
Interface you’re really hitting	In most KeepKey workflows the CLI only touches Interface 0 (bootloader, Bulk/Control class). That interface has no HID driver attached, so it’s always claimable, root or not. It can trick you into thinking “rusb works everywhere”.	The GUI tries Interface 1 (HID) first—because that’s where the wallet lives in normal mode—runs into IOHIDFamily and stops.
Code-signing rules	Unsigned binaries launched from a shell inherit whatever UID you give them; Apple’s USB policy doesn’t intervene.	A signed GUI must declare what hardware it intends to touch. Without the entitlement com.apple.security.device.usb macOS blocks even plain enumeration for sandboxed apps. Detaching the HID driver requires the managed entitlement com.apple.vm.device-access, which Apple only grants to a handful of virtualization vendors.
Apple Developer

What this means for KeepKey
Bootloader flashing is fine with rusb
Interface 0 is vendor/bulk, so neither the HID driver nor the sandbox cares. Your Tauri backend can continue to use rusb there.

Normal-mode traffic should stay on HID
• Switch Interface 1 traffic to hidapi (which uses IOHIDManager and co-exists with the kernel driver).
• You do not have to detach anything, so it works for non-root users and inside the sandbox once you add:

xml
Copy
Edit
<!-- osx/Entitlements.plist -->
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key><true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.usb</key><true/>
and reference that file in tauri.conf.json.

If you really need exclusive access to Interface 1 (not recommended for a wallet):

Ship a tiny CLI helper signed with hardened runtime, ask the user for admin rights (AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges), and run your flash/diagnostic code there.

Keep the GUI sandboxed and talk to the helper over a pipe or socket.

Testing tips

In your CLI, print both the interface number and the bInterfaceClass. If you see 0x03 (HID) and claiming still succeeds, you’re only opening—not claiming—so you’re riding on endpoint 0 control transfers rather than true HID I/O.

With Tauri, try running the same rusb snippet against Interface 0; you’ll see that it claims fine even without entitlements, confirming the distinction.

TL;DR
sudo lets a bare-metal CLI bypass macOS’s USB security layer and (on 13+) call the new detach API. A signed GUI can’t. Treat Interface 0 (bootloader) as bulk via rusb and Interface 1 (wallet) as shared HID via hidapi, add the plain device.usb entitlement for enumeration, and the “Access denied” error disappears without rooting the entire app.

How “interface 0” and “interface 1” are picked
USB interface numbers are baked into the device’s firmware.
When the host enumerates a USB device it asks for the configuration descriptor. That descriptor contains one or more interface descriptors that look like this (simplified):

field	value	meaning
bInterfaceNumber	0	first logical function
bInterfaceClass	0xFF	vendor-specific bulk (KeepKey bootloader)
…	…	…
bInterfaceNumber	1	second logical function
bInterfaceClass	0x03	HID (wallet-mode traffic)

The numbers start at 0 and increase in the order the firmware lists them; the host can’t change or reorder them, and nothing about them is random. To change the layout you’d have to re-flash the firmware—there’s no host-side API that rewrites descriptors
Stack Overflow
.

How that maps to KeepKey
Device state	VID/PID	Interfaces exposed	What lives there
Normal (“wallet”) mode	2B24:0001	0 – vendor/bulk, used for large transfers (optional)
1 – HID, all normal commands (GetFeatures, SignTx, …)
Bootloader / upgrade mode	2B24:0002	0 – vendor/bulk DFU interface only

The official firmware docs even refer to “KeepKey Interface 0” when they tell Windows users to pick a libusb driver with Zadig
GitHub
.

So your code chooses which interface to open, but you don’t assign the numbers—you simply pass the number the device advertises:

rust
Copy
Edit
handle.claim_interface(0)?;   // bulk or DFU
// or
hidapi::HidDevice::open_vid_pid(0x2b24, 0x0001)?; // HID shares interface 1
Why sudo vs. GUI makes a difference
On macOS the kernel’s IOHIDFamily driver grabs every HID interface as soon as the device enumerates.

libusb_detach_kernel_driver() is not implemented for HID on macOS, so rusb can never claim interface 1 from a sandboxed GUI; libusb’s own FAQ says: “Do not use libusb with HID devices on macOS – it will not work.”
GitHub

A root CLI appears to “work” because it usually talks only to interface 0 (bulk) where no HID driver is attached.

On Linux the kernel will release a driver-bound interface if a process with the right privileges calls LIBUSB_REQUEST_SET_INTERFACE (set_auto_detach_kernel_driver(true)), so both interfaces are claimable.

On Windows you can swap the HID driver for WinUSB with Zadig and then claim either interface from any process—but that breaks other wallet software that expects HID.

How to see the interfaces yourself
macOS: system_profiler SPUSBDataType or IORegistryExplorer → look for bInterfaceNumber.

Linux: lsusb -vd 2b24:0001 (or :0002) prints each interface descriptor.

Windows: Device Manager → View ► Devices by connection → Properties → Details ► Bus reported device description then use USBView for the descriptors.

TL;DR
Interface numbers are determined by the device, not by your app.

KeepKey in normal mode always advertises interface 0 (bulk) and interface 1 (HID); bootloader mode uses only interface 0.

Your Rust/Tauri backend picks which one to open with rusb/hidapi, but you cannot move HID off interface 1 or “randomise” those numbers.
