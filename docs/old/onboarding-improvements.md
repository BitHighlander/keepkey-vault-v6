# KeepKey Onboarding Wizard Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the KeepKey vault-v2 onboarding wizard and the implementation of a configuration file system.

## üè† Configuration File System

### Location
- **Path**: `~/.keepkey/keepkey.json`
- **Directory**: Automatically created on first use
- **Format**: JSON with pretty printing

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "isOnboarded": false,
  "theme": "dark",
  "notifications": true
}
```

### Backend Functions Added
- `is_first_time_install()` - Check if user needs onboarding
- `is_onboarded()` - Check if user has completed onboarding
- `set_onboarding_completed()` - Mark onboarding as complete
- `get_preference(key: String)` - Get a preference value
- `set_preference(key: String, value: String)` - Set a preference value
- `debug_onboarding_state()` - Debug configuration state

## üé® Onboarding Wizard Improvements

### Layout Consistency
- **Fixed Height**: All content areas now use `minH="450px"` for consistency
- **Centered Content**: All steps are properly centered and aligned
- **Uniform Sizing**: All cards use consistent `maxWidth` values
- **Responsive Design**: Steps adapt to different content sizes while maintaining consistency

### Navigation Improvements
- **Centralized Navigation**: All navigation logic moved to main wizard component
- **Consistent Buttons**: Navigation buttons are uniform across all steps
- **Proper Button States**: Previous button correctly disabled on first step
- **Enhanced Complete Button**: Final button clearly indicates "Complete Setup"

### Step-by-Step Improvements

#### Step 0: Language Selection
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Language Selection**: Language dropdown now properly saves preferences
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Save**: Language preference saved immediately when changed
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Shows confirmation when language is applied
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced UI**: Improved dropdown styling and labeling

#### Step 1: App Settings
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Layout**: Redesigned with side-by-side cards
- ‚úÖ **Visual Hierarchy**: Better organized with colored borders
- ‚úÖ **Clear Information**: More descriptive content about each setting
- ‚úÖ **Status Indicators**: Shows current setting states

#### Step 2: Security/PIN
- ‚úÖ **Improved Layout**: Side-by-side information cards
- ‚úÖ **Better Content Organization**: Clear separation of PIN and recovery info
- ‚úÖ **Visual Cues**: Color-coded sections with relevant icons
- ‚úÖ **Helpful Tips**: Added practical advice for PIN selection

#### Step 3: Recovery Phrases  
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Security Warning**: More prominent security notice
- ‚úÖ **Better Information Layout**: Organized bullet points instead of list components
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Sizing**: Standardized card dimensions
- ‚úÖ **Actionable Guidance**: Clear preparation instructions

#### Step 4: Completion
- ‚úÖ **Celebration Design**: Improved completion screen with better visual hierarchy
- ‚úÖ **Clear Next Steps**: Numbered action items for what to do next
- ‚úÖ **Helpful Tips**: Added support information
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Styling**: Gradient backgrounds and better spacing

### Technical Improvements
- **Component Architecture**: Simplified prop interfaces
- **State Management**: Proper configuration persistence
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for preference operations
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript interfaces
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns

## üîß Backend Integration

### Rust Commands
All new commands have been properly registered in the Tauri application:
- Configuration management functions
- Onboarding state tracking
- Preference storage and retrieval

### Database Integration
- Uses JSON file storage for simplicity and reliability
- Automatic directory creation
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**: All wizard steps now have uniform sizing and layout
2. **Functional Language Selection**: Language preferences are properly saved and applied
3. **Working Completion**: The final "Complete Setup" button properly marks onboarding as finished
4. **Configuration Persistence**: User preferences are saved to `~/.keepkey/keepkey.json`
5. **Better Visual Design**: Modern, clean interface with proper spacing and colors
6. **Improved Content**: More helpful and descriptive information in each step
7. **Centralized Navigation**: All button handling is consistent and reliable

## üöÄ Testing the Improvements

To test the onboarding wizard:
1. Delete any existing `~/.keepkey/keepkey.json` file
2. Start the vault-v2 application
3. The onboarding wizard should automatically appear
4. Test each step to ensure:
   - Language selection works and saves immediately
   - All steps have consistent sizing
   - Navigation buttons work properly
   - Final completion button marks onboarding as complete
   - Configuration file is created with proper values
